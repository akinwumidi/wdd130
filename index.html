        <p>Hello, my name is Israel Akinwumi, and I'm from Nigeria. I'm pursuing a major in Software Development.
            Additionally, I
            serve as the District YSA Male Representative in my District.</p>

        <p> I currently work as a frontend developer and programming instructor, teaching others how to create
            beautiful, responsive websites. I'm always learning myself, trying to keep up with the latest trends and
            best practices to become a better programmer. I'm excited about this course and hope to learn a lot.</p>

        <p>Thanks,</p>
        <p>Israel Akinwumi</p>
